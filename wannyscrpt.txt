* Please refer to the official guide, https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#configure
*
* You can either copy the configuration file from the panel manually to /etc/pterodactyl/config.yml
* or, you can use the "auto deploy" button from the panel and simply paste the command in this terminal
*
* You can then start Wings manually to verify that it's working
*
* sudo wings
*
* Once you have verified that it is working, use CTRL+C and then start Wings as a service (runs in the background)
*
* systemctl start wings
*
* Note: It is recommended to enable swap (for Docker, read more about it in official documentation).
* Note: If you haven't configured your firewall, ports 8080 and 2022 needs to be open.
